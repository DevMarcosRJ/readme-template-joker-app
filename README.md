‚≠ê This is a project to demonstrate my technical knowledge in native Android development with Kotlin. More technical information below.

Application of jokes in relation to the famous actor Chuck Norris. An app focused on the MVP architecture, 
using fragments and navigation features to make the app look more professional. With a custom launcher, splash screen,
HTTP request with Retrofit to bring categories of jokes that are in a database. Enveloping fragments with a single activity to make the app more fluid navigable.
Images with caching system, and more.
